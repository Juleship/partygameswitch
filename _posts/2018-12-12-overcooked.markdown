Overcooked is one of the main reasons why this website exists. I love it. We played this title endless hours, and it's ton of fun. But let's go to some history of this game!

Overcooked is a cooking simulation game developed by Ghost Town Games and published by Team17. Do you remember Team17? They are the team behind Worms! One of my favorite games ever. I spent so much good time in Worms World Party with my friends! Well, enough with the nostalgia.

The game is pretty simple: every player control a chef in kitchens filled with various obstacles and hazards to rapidly prepare meals to specific orders under a time limit. The Nintendo Switch version was released on July 27, 2017 and I've played it ever since.

Overcooked received positive reviews upon release, and was nominated for four awards at the 13th British Academy Games Awards, eventually winning two for Best British Game and Best Family Game. 

A sequel, Overcooked 2, was released in August 2018, but I'll cover that in another article!
